## Manual installation

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Building docker containers

Make sure the docker deamon is started.
In Linux:
service docker start

After configuring docker based on your platform, do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/faical-yannick-congo/corr-api.git
    $ cd corr-api
    $ docker build -t corr-api .

Befor you can run the corr-xxxx containers, figureout the docker vm 
or interface ip address.

### On Ubuntu run:

    $ ifconfig.
    Notice a docker0 interface and copy the ip_address.

### On Osx: run: 

    $ boot2docker ip.
    Copy the ip_address of the boot2docker vm.
    In the corr-api code, inside config.py, replace 
    'host': '192.168.59.103' in MONGODB_SETTINGS {} by
    'host': 'ip_address'.
    Then you are good to go.

### On other plateforms:

We assume that the Ubuntu case will be most likely the case for Linux
based plateforms. 

For non unix based plateforms that will probably
require a vm to run the docker containers, it will be most likely the 
same as Osx.

When you solve that based on your plateform, run:

    $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -p 28017:28017 corr-db
    $ docker run -i -t -p 5100:5100 corr-api

## Pull from docker registry

After configuring docker based on your platform, do:

    $ docker pull palingwende/corr-db
    $ docker pull palingwende/corr-api

Before you can run the containers we have to bridge the docker0 
interface to the settings in the corr-api configs of the database.

###On Ubuntu:

    $ ip link add br0 type bridge
    $ sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
    $ sudo ip addr add 192.168.59.103/20 dev br0
    $ sudo ip link set br0 up
    $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -p 28017:28017 palingwende/corr-db
    $ docker run -i -t -p 5000:5000 palingwende/corr-api

Finally to make that persistant run the following commands that will 
add the bridging to your network interfaces file.

    $ sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

Add the follwing at the end of the file:

    auto br0
    iface br0 inet static
            address 192.168.59.103
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            bridge_ports dummy0
            bridge_stp off
            bridge fd 0

###On Osx:

Run: $ boot2docker ip.
Make sure that the ip is equivalent to 192.168.59.103. If it is
you can just do the following:

    $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -p 28017:28017 palingwende/corr-db
    $ docker run -i -t -p 5100:5100 palingwende/corr-api

NOTE: 192.168.59.103 is the default boot2docker ip, unless your have
some colisions with another vm using the same ip, you are good to go.

###On other plateforms:

We assume that the Ubuntu case will be most likely the case for Linux
based plateforms. 

For non unix based plateforms that will probably
require a vm to run the docker containers, it will be most likely the 
same as Osx.

###Runnin the containers:

When you solve that based on your plateform, run:

    $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -p 28017:28017 corr-db
    $ docker run -i -t -p 5100:5100 corr-api

## Going to the API REST interfaces

Figure out your docker ip.

    If you are on linux: the ip is localhost (127.0.0.1)
    If you are on osx: $ boot2docker ip

Open the browser got to: http://ip_address:5100/

You are on the corr-api interface at this point.

## Installation
[Install docker][official]

On Osx/Non Linux: [Boot2docker][boot2docker].
        
    $ boot2docker init
    $ boot2docker start
    EXPORT the values being displayed.
    
On Linux:
        
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker.io
